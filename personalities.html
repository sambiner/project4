				<p>The Flash is the most likeable person in the Justice League.  
				He is the closest to human who is still above them, but it doesn’t go to his head.  
				He has a heart of gold and he is not afraid to show it, but he doesn’t gloat about it.
				Also, he has learned to be humble with his power, because not everybody who is a superhero has a power (like Batman, Robin, and Nightwing)</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-colspan1-b">
				<p>Wonder Woman basically thinks she is better than everybody else, and is not in touch with Earth’s traditions, since she comes from a place where no men live.  
				She is also queen there, so she thinks she is superior to men just because of that.  
				Also, she doesn't get modern societies customs, because she was raised to be a warrior and a princess, so she believes that everybody should respect her because she is a princess of a land nobody has ever heard about.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-colspan1-c">
				<p>Superman is an alien.  
				He doesn’t entirely understand Earth’s cultures since there is so many.  
				He bases his morals for saving people off of his upbringing on the Kent farm, even though he tries to fit into society.
				Even though he works in the real world, he hasn't seen a whole lot of the world.
				What he knows about society is restricted to what he knows about living on a farm and working in a press compnay, so it is not all that big.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="grid-colspan1-d">
				<p>Batman’s main reason for joining the JLA is because his parents died.   
				The reason he personified a bat is because that is the one thing that scared him the most.  
				He, also, is always grumpy and he never smiles, which doesn’t make him likeable.</p>
