				<p>This fight is no competition.  
				Wonder Woman is fast, granted by the god Hermes.  
				She can keep up with the Flash when he is just tooling around and cruising...but not when he is actually fighting and trying.  
				The Flash, with his Infinite Mass Punch can literally flatten anything, no matter how strong.  
				Wonder Woman, even though she is objectively stronger than Superman, would most likely not stand a white dwarf star colliding with her body.  
				She does have gauntlets that have never had one instance of breaking, but she can’t use it against a being that is ten times faster than light itself.  
				Also, she has a sword, but can she swing and kill something she cannot see, even on a good day?  
				Her only “weapon” is her shield, and she can only effectively block his punches, if she can get her shield up in time, that is.  
				Wonder Woman’s only weakness is a god-made weapon, or a WMD. 
				So, when she is incapacitated by Flash punching her, he can go find one of those (it would only take a second), come back and slay her in the time it takes her to fall on her butt from the impact of his punches.  
				There is literally no competition for the Flash compared to fighting Superman.  
				Even though Wonder Woman has the potential to be stronger than Superman, the Flash can defeat any opponent.</p>
